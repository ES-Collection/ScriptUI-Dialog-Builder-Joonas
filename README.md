## Info

I put this here for safe keeping, issue tracking and perhaps wiki later. I wouldn't expect anyone to contribute to the mess that is this project. It's pretty much just all prototypes bundled into one.

This epository includes a build folder, which contains the same files as in the website. So if the url doesn't work for some reason, you should be able to to download the repo and use it locally.
